# CRM 2013 – Actions Are My New Favorite Feature

So when originally previewing all the new stuff in CRM 2013 I kind of glossed over Actions.  A new type of workflow, meh, hopefully its not as worthless as Dialogs.  However, last week I had the opportunity to really dig into them and found out that they really have massive customization implications.  Including, duh, duh, dun: the ability to trigger plugin code directly with JavaScript.  “Who cares?” you ask.  We’ve always been able to do this, more or less, by creating a hidden attribute, and creating a plugin to run on Update and scoping it to that field.


Yeah, but with Actions, you can actually return a value (or values) back to the JavaScript!  What I did here last week was create a Clone function.  I haven’t really made it 100% configurable yet, in that you have to insert a button and call a JavaScript function, but its pretty neat…
