As an engineer I am deeply fascinated by Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), I've spent countless hours navigating the complex and ever-evolving landscape of neural networks. Through my journey, I've come to realize the importance of a structured approach to studying this field. Here, I want to share a roadmap that I've found incredibly useful for understanding the rich history, foundational concepts, and cutting-edge advancements in neural networks.

In future I will be sharing my review of the following papers. 


### **The Dawn of Neural Networks**

**The Early Years (1950s-1980s):** My journey began where it all started - with the perceptron, introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958. This simple yet revolutionary concept laid the groundwork for neural networks. The next pivotal moment came in 1986 with the introduction of the backpropagation algorithm, essential for training deep neural networks.

**Key Papers to Read:**
- Rosenblatt's ["The Perceptron: A Probabilistic Model for Information Storage and Organization in the Brain"](/assets/papers/rosenblatt1958.pdf)
- Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams' ["Learning representations by back-propagating errors"](/assets/papers/rumelhart1986.pdf)

### **The Rise of Deep Learning**

**Revival and Advancements (2006-2012):** I delved into the era when deep learning gained momentum. Geoffrey Hinton's work on deep belief networks in 2006 was a game-changer. Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) through Yann LeCun's work and the landmark victory of AlexNet in the ImageNet Challenge (2012) were key highlights.

**Must-Read Papers:**
- Hinton, Osindero, and Teh's ["A fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets"](/assets/papers/hinton2006.pdf)
- LeCun, Bottou, Bengio, and Haffner's ["Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition"](/assets/papers/lecun1998.pdf)
- Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton's ["ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks"](/assets/papers/krizhevsky2017.pdf)

### **Exploring Specialized Architectures**

**Diversification (2013-Present):** My exploration led me to the diversification and specialization in neural networks. I studied architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and the revolutionary Transformers. The advancements in natural language processing, evident through models like BERT and GPT, were particularly intriguing.

**Key Papers for Insight:**
- ["Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" by Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le](/assets/papers/NIPS-2014-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks-Paper.pdf)
- Goodfellow et al.'s ["Generative Adversarial Nets"](/assets/papers/1406.2661.pdf)
- Vaswani et al.'s ["Attention Is All You Need"](/assets/papers/NIPS-2017-attention-is-all-you-need-Paper.pdf)
- ["BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding" by Devlin et al.](/assets/papers/N19-1423.pdf)

### **Keeping Up with Current Trends**

**The Cutting Edge (2020-Present):** In recent times, I've focused on understanding the latest trends like few-shot learning, self-supervised learning, and the quest for AGI. Ethical considerations in AI have also been a critical part of my learning.

**Recent Papers and Trends:**
- I regularly keep up with publications in top AI conferences and journals.

### **Hands-On Implementation**

**My Practical Approach:** Theory is one aspect, but implementing these models and algorithms has been crucial in deepening my understanding. I've used TensorFlow and PyTorch for practical experiments, often turning to GitHub for community-driven projects and Kaggle for hands-on challenges.

### **Staying Ahead of the Curve**

**Continuous Learning and Engagement:** To stay updated, I follow leading AI researchers, read AI news blogs, and participate in webinars and conferences.
